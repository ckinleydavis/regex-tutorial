# Manipulating Patterns with Regular Expressions

Oftentimes it is necessary to work with data that requires transformation before it can be loaded into a data store or perhaps each occurance of a word or phrase needs to be found in a large data set. 

In such cases regular expressions can be coded and used to produce the required result through pattern matching. No matter the programming language, regular expressions is a vital concept to learn and use. 

The following is a simple JavaScript tutorial on how to use a regular expression to count the number of times a particular word appears in a bit of text. 

## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.
